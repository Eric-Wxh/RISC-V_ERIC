compile_design: info: single top `adder' found, setting it as top for subsequent analysis [set_option top adder]
0 {Rule-checking completed without errors or warnings}current_goal: info: current goal selection with -alltop has reset the last active top `adder'.
                    It is recommended to maintain goal runs with -alltop in a separate project file.
                    You can save this project after setting the top again with `set_option top adder',
                    and then start a different project for -alltop runs.
